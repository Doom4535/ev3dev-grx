<h1>Known GRX problems and things that must be improved</h1>
<h2>General:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The memory driver allocates all planes in one chunk instead
of using real planes.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Win32 driver:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Drawline can be faster. Now when we paint a long diagonal line,
the
invalidate rect is very big.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Add a 16 bpp framedriver.
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>X11 driver:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try to make GrPixel faster.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>The driver can't respond to PAINT events, so it has problems with
XFree86 v4 because the backing-store is not enabled by default. The
best solution is to have a context to save the actual window (and the
GrPixel problem can be solved too). The workaround is to add next lines
to the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file, in the Device section:
    <p> Option "BackingStore"
    </p>
    <p> Option "SaveUnders"
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Linux console framebuffer driver:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Try to change modes if the underlaying framebuffer driver allow
it.
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li>Complete the alternate direct mouse driver (now it only handles
PS/2 and IMPS2 mice).
    <p></p>
  </li>
</ul>
