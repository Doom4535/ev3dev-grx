<h1>Known GRX problems and things that must be improved</h1>

<h2>General:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The memory driver allocates all planes in one chunk instead
of using real planes.
<p>
<li>Printing in 1200dpi on Laserjet supporting PCL6 doesn't work.
</ul>

<h2>Linux console framebuffer driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to change modes if the underlaying framebuffer driver allow it.
<p>
<li>Complete the alternate direct mouse driver (now it only handles
PS/2 mouses) to have a svgalib free GRX.
<p>
<li>When in graphics mode, the virtual console switching is disabled
by default, so some code is necesary to enable it.
<p>
<li>Only 15, 16 and 24bpp framedrivers are provided.
</ul>

<h2>Win32 driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>There is a general design problem. The video driver is initiated
    at the begining instead when the user program call GrSetDriver (usually
    indirectly by calling GrSetMode), this makes difficult the use the
    memory driver.
<p>
<li>Logical operations for 8 bpp are wrong implemented, they must operate
    with color indices instead of colors.
<p>
<li>Drawline must paint the last point (not trivial).
<p>
<li>Add support for all logical operations in drawpixel, drawblock and
    putscanline.
<p>
<li>Implement getiscanline for 8 and 24 bpp.
<p>
<li>Implement bltv2r for 24 bpp.
<p>
<li>Implement full screen mode when maximum resolution is required.
<p>
<li>The printing code doesn't work.
</ul>

<h2>X11 driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Investigate why bccbgi test program doesn't restart when it switchs to
    text mode.
<p>
<li>Try to make GrPixel faster.
<p>
<li>The driver can't respond to PAINT events, so it has problems with
    XFree86 v4 because the backing-store is not enabled by default. The
    best solution is to have a context to save the actual window (and
    the GrPixel problem can be solved too). Te workaround is to add 
    next lines to the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file, in the Device section:
<p>      Option "BackingStore"
<p>      Option "SaveUnders"
</ul>

<h2>SVGALIB driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The mouse jumps more than one pixel.
</ul>

<h2>VGA DOS driver:</h2>
<ul>
<li>It can be improved a lot, replacing the generic funtions it uses.
</ul>
