=================

The following API docs are available:

* `C API <c-api/index.html>`_
* `JavaScript (Gjs) API <gjs-api/index.html>`_
* `Python API <python-api/index.html>`_
* `Vala API <vala-api/grx-3.0/index.htm>`_

.. note:: The C API docs are organized nicely and have additional notes, so even if you
    are using another programming language, you may find it useful to refer to the
    C API docs as well.
